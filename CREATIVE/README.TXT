John,

This is the code I just sent to Bill Volk at Activision.  Let me know if you 
have any problems with it.

Bill,

This version seems to fix the problems with Microchannel boards.  Seems the
microchannel machines don't like you reading the DMA controller.

This version also fixes the lost MIDI data.

If I didn't make any mistakes, it should be much more stable also.

See the Information header at the top of SHELL.ASM for a list of changes.
Also, any updates that I made to the code can be found by searching for my
initials ";SES".
