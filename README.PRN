SHELL.MAK is the Microsoft Make file.
Requires Borland Assembler and Microsoft Make.

The make file FSHELL.MAK builds foreground versions of the 8253 Timer interrupt
based drivers.

The source code to all DigPak sound drivers is in the single file SHELL.ASM.
It is conditionally assembled to produce all of the many versions of the DigPak
sound drivers.
